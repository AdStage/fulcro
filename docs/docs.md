# Getting Started

Fulcro has a number of resources that can get you going.

## Getting Started Instructions

The [Getting Started](https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro/blob/develop/GettingStarted.adoc) document is a good place to start to see a full-stack application.

## Developer's Guide

The [Developer's Guide](guide.html) is interactive. You can view it online, but you should really clone Fulcro itself, and run it via the instructions in the README.

It includes coding exercises and covers most topics in great detail.
It is written in an order that most naturally fits what you'll need to know as you progress in your use of Fulcro.

## Cheat Sheet

A quick summary of common calls and such are laid out in a concise form
in the [Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/fulcrologic/fulcro/blob/develop/docs/CheatSheet.adoc)

## Video Guides

There are a number of helpful videos on Fulcro:

More new videos are being built and added, but there are some old videos from when the tools
were named Untangled. These older videos are a little outdated, but contain useful 
information:

## Talks About Fulcro

I've given a few talks on Fulcro (when it was named Untangled). Again, use the playlist control at
the top-left of the video to choose what you want to watch.

## API Documentation

Most functions have good doc strings that explain the purpose of the function. Use your IDE's help to see these documentation elements.
